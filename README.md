# Instruction on how to run the app

1. From the root folder
   npm install: to install server dependencies
   npm run client-install: to install client(react) dependencies
2. To run both the client and server with one command
   npm run dev

Note: the backend server runs at port 4000. So if you are using it already, you can change it in server.js
