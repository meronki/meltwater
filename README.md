# Instruction on how to run the app

1. From the root folder
   - npm install: to install server dependencies
   - npm run client-install: to install client(react) dependencies
2. To run both the client and server with one command
   npm run dev
3. To test the app when asked to enter keywords or phrases
   use the dummy data text found in description in data.js

Note: the backend server runs at port 4000. So if you are using it already, you can change it in server.js
